      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I'm Josh Kernick; I was born and grew up in London and have just
        turned 18. I have 8 GCSE, including an A in maths and physics and a B
        in English. My first encounter with programming was using
        <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> in year 7, but my school didn't really offer
        much computing beyond the ICT course.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first got into programming when I chose computing for A-levels
        along with maths and physics. I found computing super interesting and
        got into programming to the of my other subjects. I got an A in my
        computing AS but my other grades meant I would need to repeat the year.
        I decided to leave formal education and seek work as a novice
        programmer. Since September I have been teaching myself, focusing on
        Python and styles of programming - such as object oriented. Recently
        I have also been looking at HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In looking for apprenticeships and other ways to study I came across
        Founders and Coders. I really like that the course aims to place
        graduates in employment and the course covers many aspects of
        programming that I've been struggling to study fully on my own. I
        also look forward to working in a team with people who are as
        interesting in programming as I am. My father tells me that teaching
        something is the best way to learn it - and he is always right, so the
        course structure involving both learning and teaching will clearly
        give me what I need to get my foot into the world of work.

      <h1>Building this site</h1>
      <p>My first experience with HTML and CSS came from a free course on
        Codecademy, which helped me learn the basics of the two. I then took a Udacity
        course on responsive web design. This tought me to first design the site
        for mobile, and scale up from there, and to use media queries to make the
        site more responsive.</p>

      <p>This responsive design can be seen mainly on page 2 of the site, the content
        flows as the page is re-sized, allowing it to look good on all devices.
        The design of the site if simple, the content is put in articles, and there
        are 3 different pages. I chose for a darker themed site as I think it looks
        better, although I am thinking about adding an option for a light mode.
        The color was a dark grey at first, but I noticed that adding a little bit
        of blue to the colors made it looks a little less bland, while still remaining
        dark.</p>

      <h1>Real Rockets in Kerbal Space Program</h1>
      <p>This page is about Kerbal Space Program (KSP), a rocket simulator with
        a realistic physics engine. I took rockets from the real world an recreated
        then in KSP, trying to make them as realsic as possible, from the engine
        and stage count, to the propellant used and the overall design of the rocket.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The Space Shuttle is one of the most recognisable rockets in history, this
          particular image is of STS-120, flown by Space Shuttle Discorvery on 23/10/2007,
          carrying the Harmoney module (node 2) to the ISS.</p>
        <p>In order to get Discorvery to the ISS, the Space Shuttle used 3 RS-25 engines
          fueled by LH2/LOX, and two solid rocket boosteres attached on either
          side of the large orange tank. The KSP replica uses a white tank, just like
          the first two Shuttle missions. The white paint was removed after STS-2,
          increasing the payload capacity.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, the Delta V Heavy is
            now the largest capacity rocket in operation. At $400 million per launch,
            the Delta V heavy can get a payload of 28,790kg to LEO (Low Earth Orbit),
            using 628,420kg of propellant in the process.</p>
          <p>Both the real rocket and the KSP (Kerbal Space Program) replica use LH2/LOX
            to fuel both stages, but unlike the real rocket, the replica includes fuel
            pumps leading from the side boosters to the center core. The Falcon Heavy
            will feature simlar fuel crossfeed, but seeing as this is much harder to
            implement in real life, only 6/9 engines in the center core will be feuled
            from the side boosters.</p>

        <img src="images/Atlas_V_551_KSP.png" alt="Atlas V 551 in KSP">
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>The Atlas V is a 2 stage rocket operated by ULA (United Launch Alliance).
          The first stage uses a single RD-180 engine, fueled by RP-1/LOX, while the
          second stage uses LH2/LOX to fuel its RL10 engine.</p>
        <p>Perhaps what is most interesting about the Atlas V is the configuration
          of its SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters). As seen
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V#/media/File:Atlas_V_family.png">here</a>,
          there SRBs are asymmetrical, meaning the thrust does not line up with
          the center of mass. This would cause the rocket to rotate, but the engine
          on the first stage can gimbal (pivot) to cancel out this rotation.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p>The Saturn 1B played an important part in getting the first men on the moon.
          It's resemblance to the Saturn V is no coincident, much of the hardware used
          on the Saturn V was tested on the Saturn 1B, such as the CSM (Command/Service Module),
          the LM (Lunar Module), and the S-IVB upper stage. It flew the Apollo 5 mission,
          and sent crew to Skylab, an old America space station.</p>
        <p>Just the the real thing, the KSP replica has 8 engines in its first stage,
          burning RP-1/LOX, and a single engine burning LH2/LOX in the S-IVB upper
          stage. The replica can be seen shortly after lift off, taking the CSM to orbit.</p>

      <p>The ISS orbits at an altitude of 100km, with a velocity of 7672 m/s and
        takes 92 minutes to orbit the Earth.</p>
      <p>The moon orbits at about 400,000km, taking 28 days on to orbit, and has
        a velocity of just 990 m/s.
