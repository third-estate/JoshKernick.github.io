    <h1>Real Rockets in Kerbal Space Program</h1>

    <div class="one">
      <h2>Delta V Heavy</h2>

      </div>

      <p>Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, the Delta V Heavy is
        now the largest capacity rocket in operation. At $400 million per launch,
        the Delta V heavy can get a payload of 28,790kg to LEO, using 628,420kg
        of propellant in the process.
      </br></br>
        Both the real rocket and the KSP replica use LH2 and LOX to fuel both stages,
        but unlike the real rocket, the replica includes fuel pumps leading from
        the side boosters to the core tank</p>
    </div>

    <div class="one">
      <h2>Space Shuttle</h2>

      <div class="pics">

      </div>

      <p>The Space Shuttle is one of the most recognisable rockets in history, this
        particular image is of STS-120, flown by Space Shuttle Discorvery on 23/10/2007,
        carrying the Harmoney module (node 2) to the ISS.
      </br></br>
        In order to get Discorvery to the ISS, the Space Shuttle used 3 RS-25 engines
        fueled by LH2 and LOX, and two solid rocket boosteres attached on either
        side of the large orange tank. The KSP replica uses a white tank, just like
        the first two Shuttle missions. The white paint was removed after STS-2,
        increasing the payload capacity.</p>

      <h2>Space Shuttle (Orbiter)</h2>

      <p>On the left is a picture of the Space Shuttle Atlantis shortly before landing
        at the KSC following STS-122. On the right is the KSP replica, firing it's
        OME (Orbital Maneuvering Engines) as is prepares for its journey back home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="one">
      <h2>Atlas V 551</h2>

      <div class="pics">
        <img src="Atlas_V_551.jpg" alt="Atlas V 551">
        <img src="Atlas_V_551_KSP.png" alt="Atlas V 551 in KSP">
      </div>

      <p>The Atlas V is a 2 stage rocket operated by ULA. The first stage uses one
        RD-180 engine, fueled by RP-1/LOX, while the second stage uses LH2/LOX to
        fuel its single RL10 engine.
      </br></br>
        Perhaps what is most interesting about the Atlas V is the configuration
        of its SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters). As seen
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V#/media/File:Atlas_V_family.png">here</a>,
        there SRBs are not symmetrical, which mean the thrust does not line up with
        the center of mass. This would cause the rocket to rotate, but the engine
        on the first stage can gimbal to cancel out this rotation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="one">
      <h2>Saturn 1B</h2>

      <div class="pics">
        <img src="Saturn_1B.jpg" alt="Saturn 1B">
        <img src="Saturn_1B_KSP.png" alt="Saturn 1B in KSP">
      </div>

      <p>The Saturn 1B played an important part in getting the first men to the moon.
        Its resemblance to the Saturn V is no coincident, much of the Saturn V harware
        was tested on the Saturn 1B, such as the CSM (Command/Service Module), the Lunar
        Module, and the S-IVB upper stage. It flew the Apollo 5 mission, and sent
        crew to Skylab, America's current space station.
      </br></br>
        Just the the real thing, the KSP replica has 8 engines in its first stage,
        burning RP-1/LOX, and a single engine burning LH2/LOX in the S-IVB upper
        stage. The replica can be seen taking the CSD to orbit, just like it did
        in real life.</p>

    <h1>Using Python to control rockets in KSP</h1>

    <div class="one">
      <p>Controlling rockets by hand itn't easy, but the mod
        <a href="https://krpc.github.io/krpc/">kRPC</a>
        allows you to write code in languages, such as Python, to conrol rockets
        in KSP.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="one">
      <h2>Gravity turn</h2>
      <p>I made a simple Python program that will control the pitch, roll and yaw
        of the rocket, and will guide it into space. The only thing you have to
        control is the throttle and staging. The program changes your pitch based
        uppon the rockets altitude, for every 500m gained in altitude, the pitch
        decreases by 1°, capped out at 0°.
