    <h1>Real Rockets in Kerbal Space Program</h1>

      <h2>Delta V Heavy</h2>

      </div>

      <p>Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, the Delta V Heavy is
        now the largest capacity rocket in operation. At $400 million per launch,
        the Delta V heavy can get a payload of 28,790kg to LEO (Low Earth Orbit),
        using 628,420kg of propellant in the process.
      </br></br>
        Both the real rocket and the KSP (Kerbal Space Program) replica use LH2/LOX
        to fuel both stages, but unlike the real rocket, the replica includes fuel
        pumps leading from the side boosters to the center core. The Falcon Heavy
        will feature simlar fuel crossfeed, but seeing as this is much harder to
        implement in real life, only 6/9 engines in the center core will be feuled
        from the side boosters.</p>

      <h2>Space Shuttle</h2>

      </div>

      <p>The Space Shuttle is one of the most recognisable rockets in history, this
        particular image is of STS-120, flown by Space Shuttle Discorvery on 23/10/2007,
        carrying the Harmoney module (node 2) to the ISS.
      </br></br>
        In order to get Discorvery to the ISS, the Space Shuttle used 3 RS-25 engines
        fueled by LH2/LOX, and two solid rocket boosteres attached on either
        side of the large orange tank. The KSP replica uses a white tank, just like
        the first two Shuttle missions. The white paint was removed after STS-2,
        increasing the payload capacity.</p>

      <p>On the left is a picture of the Space Shuttle Atlantis shortly before landing
        at the KSC following STS-122. On the right is the KSP replica, firing it's
        OME (Orbital Maneuvering Engines) as is prepares for its journey back home.</p>

      <h2>Atlas V 551</h2>

      <div class="pics">
        <img src="images/Atlas_V_551.jpg" alt="Atlas V 551">
        <img src="images/Atlas_V_551_KSP.png" alt="Atlas V 551 in KSP">
      </div>

      <p>The Atlas V is a 2 stage rocket operated by ULA (United Launch Alliance).
        The first stage uses a single RD-180 engine, fueled by RP-1/LOX, while the
        second stage uses LH2/LOX to fuel its RL10 engine.
      </br></br>
        Perhaps what is most interesting about the Atlas V is the configuration
        of its SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters). As seen
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V#/media/File:Atlas_V_family.png">here</a>,
        there SRBs are asymmetrical, meaning the thrust does not line up with
        the center of mass. This would cause the rocket to rotate, but the engine
        on the first stage can gimbal (pivot) to cancel out this rotation.</p>

      <h2>Saturn 1B</h2>

      <div class="pics">
        <img src="images/Saturn_1B.jpg" alt="Saturn 1B">
        <img src="images/Saturn_1B_KSP.png" alt="Saturn 1B in KSP">
      </div>

      <p>The Saturn 1B played an important part in getting the first men on the moon.
        It's resemblance to the Saturn V is no coincident, much of the hardware used
        on the Saturn V was tested on the Saturn 1B, such as the CSM (Command/Service Module),
        the LM (Lunar Module), and the S-IVB upper stage. It flew the Apollo 5 mission,
        and sent crew to Skylab, an old America space station.
      </br></br>
        Just the the real thing, the KSP replica has 8 engines in its first stage,
        burning RP-1/LOX, and a single engine burning LH2/LOX in the S-IVB upper
        stage. The replica can be seen shortly after lift off, taking the CSM to orbit.</p>

    <h1>Using Python to control rockets in Kerbal Space Program</h1>

    <div class="one">
      <p>Controlling rockets by hand itn't easy, but the mod
        <a href="https://krpc.github.io/krpc/">kRPC</a>
        allows you to write code in languages, such as Python, to conrol rockets
        in KSP.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="one">
      <h2>Gravity turn</h2>
      <p>I made a simple Python program that will control the pitch, roll and yaw
        of the rocket, and will guide it into space. The only thing you have to
        control is the throttle and staging. The program changes your pitch based
        uppon the rockets altitude, for every 500m gained in altitude, the pitch
        decreases by 1°, capped out at 0°.
