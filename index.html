      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I'm Josh Kernick; I was born and grew up in London and have just
        turned 18. I have 8 GCSE, including an A in maths and physics and a B
        in English. My first encounter with programming was using
        <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> in year 7,
        but didn't do anything beyond that untill I chose to do computing for A-levels
        along with maths and physics. I got an A in my computing AS but my other
        grades meant I would need to repeat the year. Lately I have been teaching
        myself HTML and CSS, and some JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In looking for apprenticeships and other ways to study I came across
        Founders and Coders. I really like that the course aims to place
        graduates in employment and that the course covers many aspects of
        programming that I've been struggling to study on my own. Attending
        the course will give me a structure to work with that I have
        found hard to create independently. Having the task of creating this
        website has been very helpful in my studying of HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <h1>Building this site</h1>
      <p>My first experience with HTML and CSS came from a free course on
        Codecademy, which helped me learn the basics of the two. I then took a Udacity
        course on responsive web design. This taught me to first design the site
        for mobile and scale up from there using media queries to make the
        site responsive.</p>

      <p>This responsive design can be seen mainly on the 'KSP tab' of the site. The content
        flows as the page is re-sized allowing it to look good on all devices.
        The design of the site is simple. The content for each tab corresponds
        to a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element. Contained within each
        section are a number of <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s that get
        displayed in lighter grey boxes.</p>

      <p>I chose a darker themed site as I think it looks
        better. I am thinking about adding a switch for a light mode but haven't
        worked out how to do this yet.
        Initially the color was a plain dark grey, but I noticed that adding a
        little bit of blue made it look less bland.</p>

      <p>I looked at various ways to do the tabs using just CSS but I struggled
        to combine this with the design. In the end I opted for a bit of
        JavaScript to set the display style property of the section elements
        in order to make the tabs function. I also added a JavaScript calculator
        on the third tab and experimented with some responsive styling on that.</p>

      <p>I used the <code>-webkit-scrollbar</code> webkit specific
        CSS element to test out the browser specific style elements. In Chrome
        the scrollbar design is in keeping with the dark (with a bit of blue) theme.</p>

      <h1>Real Rockets in Kerbal Space Program</h1>
      <p>This page is about Kerbal Space Program (KSP), a rocket simulator with
        a realistic physics engine. I took rockets from the real world an recreated
        then in KSP, trying to make them as realsic as possible, from the engine
        and stage count, to the propellant used and the overall design of the rocket.</p>
      <p>Each section is about a different rocket, and has two pictures. The picture
        of the left is of the real rocket, and the one on the right is my KSP replica.
        There is also some info about the rocket on the right or under the picures,
        depending on the size of your brouser.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The Space Shuttle is one of the most recognisable rockets in history, this
          particular image is of STS-120, flown by Space Shuttle Discovery on 23/10/2007,
          carrying the Harmony module (node 2) to the ISS.</p>
        <p>In order to get Discovery to the ISS, the Space Shuttle used 3 RS-25 engines
          fueled by LH2/LOX, and two solid rocket boosters attached on either
          side of the large orange tank. The KSP replica uses a white tank, just like
          the first two Shuttle missions. The white paint was removed after STS-2,
          increasing the payload capacity.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, the Delta V Heavy is
            now the largest capacity rocket in operation. At $400 million per launch,
            the Delta V heavy can get a payload of 28,790kg to LEO (Low Earth Orbit),
            using 628,420kg of propellant in the process.</p>
          <p>Both the real rocket and the KSP (Kerbal Space Program) replica use LH2/LOX
            to fuel both stages, but unlike the real rocket, the replica includes fuel
            pumps leading from the side boosters to the center core. The Falcon Heavy
            will feature simlar fuel crossfeed, but seeing as this is much harder to
            implement in real life, only 6/9 engines in the center core will be feuled
            from the side boosters.</p>

        <img src="images/Atlas_V_551_KSP.png" alt="Atlas V 551 in KSP">
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>The Atlas V is a 2 stage rocket operated by ULA (United Launch Alliance).
          The first stage uses a single RD-180 engine, fueled by RP-1/LOX, while the
          second stage uses LH2/LOX to fuel its RL10 engine.</p>
        <p>Perhaps what is most interesting about the Atlas V is the configuration
          of its SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters). As seen
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V#/media/File:Atlas_V_family.png">here</a>,
          there SRBs are asymmetrical, meaning the thrust does not line up with
          the center of mass. This would cause the rocket to rotate, but the engine
          on the first stage can gimbal (pivot) to cancel out this rotation.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The Saturn 1B played an important part in getting the first men on the moon.
          It's resemblance to the Saturn V is no coincident; much of the hardware used
          on the Saturn V was tested on the Saturn 1B, such as the CSM (Command/Service Module),
          the LM (Lunar Module) and the S-IVB upper stage. It flew the Apollo 5 mission,
          and sent crew to Skylab, an old America space station.</p>
        <p>Just the the real thing, the KSP replica has 8 engines in its first stage
          burning RP-1/LOX and a single engine burning LH2/LOX in the S-IVB upper
          stage. The replica can be seen shortly after lift off, taking the CSM to orbit.</p>

      <h1>Other programming work</h1>
        <p>I have put a few programs up on Github that I have developed as I've been
          teaching myself since leaving school.</p>

        <p><strong>kRPC</strong> is mod for Kerbal Space Program that allows you to control your
          rockets using languages such as Python. My Gravity Turn script
          helps me to launch a SpaceX like rocket. It controls the launch and
          the second stage after separation, allowing me to land the first stage.
          Without this script I was unable to manage both stages manually and
          would have to chose to lose one of them.</p>
        <p>The BRF script launches and perfectly lands back on the ground
          a Kerbal replica of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFR_(rocket)">
            SpaceX's next generation rocket</a>.</p>
        <p>The Kerbal scripts are in the
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JoshKernick/kRPC">kRPC</a>
          repository on my Github.</p>

        <p>My <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JoshKernick/Projects">Projects</a>
          repository contains some Python code that I have written. I wrote a Pong
          and Snake game using object orientation to learn about that programming
          style. I had previously adapted someone else's Snake game to play itself
          and this was in a procedural style. I found that object orientation made
          the programme easier to think about because it contained related things
          together.</p>
        <p>The Falling game I wrote for my sister and the Eight queens problem
          was something my Dad asked if I could do. I managed to solve the
          Eight queens problem in just one line of code.</p>
