      <p>Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, the Delta V Heavy is
        now the largest capacity rocket in operation. At $400 million per launch,
        the Delta V heavy can get a payload of 28,790kg to LEO (Low Earth Orbit),
        using 628,420kg of propellant in the process.
      </br></br>
        Both the real rocket and the KSP (Kerbal Space Program) replica use LH2/LOX
        to fuel both stages, but unlike the real rocket, the replica includes fuel
        pumps leading from the side boosters to the center core. The Falcon Heavy
        will feature simlar fuel crossfeed, but seeing as this is much harder to
        implement in real life, only 6/9 engines in the center core will be feuled
        from the side boosters.</p>
